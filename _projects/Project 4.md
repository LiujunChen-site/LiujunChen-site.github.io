### Purposes ###
The purpose of this study is to investigate how key metabolites, specifically L-isoleucine and L-carnitine, influence the progression of liver fibrosis. We aim to determine whether these metabolites exert protective or modulatory effects on hepatic stellate cell activation, fibrotic gene expression, and lipid accumulation in the liver. By exploring their mechanistic roles, this project seeks to uncover novel therapeutic avenues for metabolic liver diseases such as NAFLD and NASH.

### Outcomes ###
- Two manuscripts are currently in preparation/submission based on the findings of this project.
