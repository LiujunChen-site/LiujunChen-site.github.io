### Purposes ###
The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of MIF in regulating HSL, a key enzyme in mediating lipolysis in adipose tissue. Our findings demonstrate that MIF has both transcriptional and non-transcriptional effects on mediating HSL through activating AMPK signaling pathway, which regulates the development of adipocyte hypertrophy and obesity.
