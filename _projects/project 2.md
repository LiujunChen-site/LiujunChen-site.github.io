### Purposes ###
The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Our results showed that MIF has a non-inflammatory effect on triggering NAFLD through stabilizing its cell membrane receptor, CD74. This suggests that MIF may play a key role in regulating the development of NAFLD following high fat diet feeding.[(Liujun Chen et al. (2023))](https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/72/Supplement_1/1598-P/150089/1598-P-MIF-upregulated-CD74-in-Liver-Contributes?searchresult=1).

### Outcomes ###
One first-authored manuscript is ready to be submitted,One poster will be presented in the 83rd American Diabetes Association in June 2023.
