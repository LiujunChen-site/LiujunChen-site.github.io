### Purposes ###
The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Our results showed that MIF has a non-inflammatory effect on triggering NAFLD through stabilizing its cell membrane receptor, CD74. This suggests that MIF may play a key role in regulating the development of NAFLD following high fat diet feeding.[(Liujun Chen et al. (2014))](https://www.abstractsonline.com/notify/notifyIntro.asp?Mkey=d4a79502-d9a3-4baa-963e-ab1e5172c158&NKey=EF972A85-C734-4382-B45E-5093A4A6481A).

### Outcomes ###
One first-authored manuscript is ready to be submitted,One poster will be presented in the 83rd American Diabetes Association in June 2023.
