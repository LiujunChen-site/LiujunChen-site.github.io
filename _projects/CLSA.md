The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging is a national prospective study, following a cohort of more than 50,000 individuals aged between 45 and 85 years old for 20 years since 2012. More details refer to [their official website](https://www.clsa-elcv.ca/).

### Purposes ###
The purposes of this project are using the data from the CLSA to: 1) validate a model for community ambulation that was developed for stroke patients [(Barclay et al. (2014))](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269215514546769)), 2) develop a model for mobility based on a conceptual framework [(Webber et al. (2010))](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20145017/)) for people aged 65+ and people with arthritis on knees or hips, respectively. In addition, measurement invariance was tested for age and sex.

### My Roles ###
* Conducted data quality check and preprocessing
* Conducted all the data analyses, including structural equation modeling as the main statistical method
* Generated a visual diagram the explicitly depicts the complex relationship of a number of variables 
* Regularly reported and discussed progress, decisions need to make, and results with Dr. Barclay and Dr. Webber
* Wrote the methods and results sections for two manuscripts, edit and review the whole manuscripts

### Outcomes ###
Two manuscripts are under preparation.
