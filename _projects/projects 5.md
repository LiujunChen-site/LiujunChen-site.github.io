### Purposes ###
This project investigates the therapeutic potential of HTH-01-015, a selective NUAK1 inhibitor, in mitigating liver fibrosis and hepatic lipid accumulation. By targeting hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and fibrotic gene expression, the study evaluates whether NUAK1 inhibition can disrupt fibrosis development. The project also explores the compound's effect on lipid metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial dysfunction. This dual focus aims to identify NUAK1 as a key regulatory node linking fibrogenesis and steatosis in chronic liver diseases such as NASH and MAFLD.

### Outcomes ###
- Significant reduction in Col1A1 and α-SMA expression observed in LX-2 and Col1A1-GFP mice models treated with HTH-01-015.
- In vitro and ex vivo assays revealed decreased extracellular matrix deposition and enhanced mitochondrial function upon NUAK1 inhibition.
- Quantitative imaging, Western blotting, and qPCR analyses support HTH-01-015’s anti-fibrotic and metabolic benefits.
- One manuscript under preparation for journal submission.
