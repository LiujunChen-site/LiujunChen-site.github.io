### Purposes ###
The purposes of this project are using the data from the CLSA to: a) develop a model adapted from the conceptual framework of the GOOUT intervention [(Salbach et al. (2019))](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/4/e029393), b) explore the complex relationship among individual characteristics and environmental characteristics and outdoor walking in older adults with outdoor walking difficulties.

* Applied for ethics approval to use the data
* Cleaned data from RedCap
* Conducted data quality check and preprocessing
* Extracted and prepared data for researchers who will be using the GO-OUT data
* Generated descriptive statistics and exploratory analyses for researchers who used the GO-OUT data
* Conducted all the data analyses, in which the structural equation modeling is the main statistical method
* Regularly reported, discussed progress and results with Dr. Barclay and Dr. Webber
* Wrote the manuscript, edited and reviewed it based on coauthors' comments

### Outcomes ###

### What is the GO-OUT study? ###
The Getting Older adults OUTdoors (GO-OUT) is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a theory-based and task-oriented outdoor walking program for older adults with difficulties walking outdoors. It collected data at four time points (baseline, 3, 5.5, and 12 months) on about 200 participants since 2018.
