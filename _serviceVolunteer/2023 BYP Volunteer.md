The Biomedical Youth Program summer camp is offered free of charge to students in Grades 5-12 who are interested in science (https://umanitoba.ca/health-sciences/community-and-partners/biomedical-youth-program-summer-camp).
During her tenure as a volunteer at BYP (Biotechnology Youth Program), Liujun played a pivotal role in guiding aspiring indigenous students from Grades 5 to 12 through various experiments. She provided comprehensive guidance on executing these experiments effectively, offering ample background knowledge to foster a deeper understanding of the scientific principles at play.

In this capacity, she aimed to create an interactive and engaging learning environment where students could not only conduct experiments but also grasp the underlying scientific concepts. Through personalized experiment designs and one-on-one guidance, she encouraged active participation and critical thinking, empowering the students to immerse themselves in the fascinating world of biotechnology.
