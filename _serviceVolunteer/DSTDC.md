This council was built by Naomi Hamm, Marcello Nesca and Yixiu Liu with support from the CHI leadership since May 2020. Our role is to be a connection between CHI leadership and trainees (graduate students & postdocs) to help them better adapt to graduate life, develop professional skills and get prepared before entering the workforce, as well as improve trainees’ experience working/studying at CHI through organizing events and workshops.
