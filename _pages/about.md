Yixiu Liu is a PhD candidate concentrating in Biostiatics, supervised by [Dr. Depeng Jiang](https://depengjiang.github.io), in the Department of Community Health Sciences (CHS) at the University of Manitoba. Her thesis focuses on developing new Bayesian approaches for joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data. She is also a trainee at the Data Science Platform at the [George & Fay Yee Centre for Health Innovation (CHI)](https://umanitoba.ca/centre-for-healthcare-innovation/). 

Yixiu works as a Biostatistician at the Cardiac Science Manitoba at the St. Boniface Hospital, Winnipeg, Manitoba. She provides statistical consulting and conducts data analysis for a research team with primary members of [Dr. Shuangbo Liu](https://cardiacsciencesmb.ca/staff/shuangbo-liu/), [Dr. John Ducas](https://cardiacsciencesmb.ca/staff/john-ducas/), [Dr. Lorraine Avery](https://cardiacsciencesmb.ca/staff/lorraine-avery/), and [Dr. Ashish Shah](https://cardiacsciencesmb.ca/staff/ashish-shah/)

Her research focus is on developing new statistical methods for health-related studies and program evaluation, and on conducting novel applications of existing methods. Her research and work experience cover:

* Bayesian inference 
* Longitudinal data analysis
* Survival analysis
* Joint model of longitudinal and survival outcomes
* Person-oriented statistical approach (i.e., latent class analysis)
* Structural equation modeling
* Epidemiology
* Spatial epidemiology and disease mapping 
* Administrative database
* Data linkage
