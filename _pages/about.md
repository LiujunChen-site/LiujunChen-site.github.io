Liujun Chen is a PhD candidate concentrating in metabolism dysfunction, supervised by [Dr. Dake Qi](https://umanitoba.ca/pharmacy/faculty-staff/dake-qi), in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Manitoba. Her thesis focuses on studing the novel role of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) in metabolism dysfunction,includinng adiposity and nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD).

Liujun is a highly motivated and skilled PhD student currently working in Dr. Qi's lab. With four years of PhD study under her belt, she is now preparing to apply for postdoctoral positions. Liujun's research interests lie in the study of peripheral tissues, specifically adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle, and their roles in metabolism. Looking towards her future research goals, Liujun is interested in further exploring the special metabolic patterns of cancer cells. She is passionate about making contributions to the field of cancer therapy and hopes to use her expertise in metabolism to aid in the development of new treatment options. Through her work in Dr. Qi's lab, Liujun has gained valuable experience in experimental design, data analysis, and critical thinking. She has also demonstrated excellent communication and collaboration skills, both within her lab and with external collaborators.
Liujun's passion for research, coupled with her technical expertise and collaborative nature, make her an excellent candidate for postdoctoral positions in the field of metabolism and cancer therapy.
